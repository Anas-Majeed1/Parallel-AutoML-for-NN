<h1>Parallel AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) for Neural Networks</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Automating the design of neural network architectures is a complex task, requiring exploration of
numerous architecture candidates. Traditional methods of manually searching for the best architecture are
time-consuming and computationally expensive. The goal of this project is to leverage Automated
Machine Learning (AutoML) techniques, combined with parallel processing, to expedite this search
process. We will design and implement a system that performs Neural Architecture Search (NAS) in
parallel, thereby optimizing multiple architectures simultaneously and identifying the most effective one
more efficiently.</p>
